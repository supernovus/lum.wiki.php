# lum.wiki.php

## Summary

Despite the name this is not a traditional wiki engine.
It's simply a content rendering engine that combines the abilities of
Twig, Markdown, and Textile into one, and makes adding wiki-like links
simple. There's not much documentation at the moment, I'll fix that later.

## TODO

 * Write documentation.
 * Write tests.

## Official URLs

This library can be found in two places:

 * [Github](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.wiki.php)
 * [Packageist](https://packagist.org/packages/lum/lum-wiki)
